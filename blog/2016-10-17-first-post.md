title: First Post!
description: The first post on my new blog.
---

I used to blog many years ago, but I eventually ran out of desire to
update it.  I suspect that as my ability to *do things* increased, my
ability to *write about opinions* decreased.  Lately, however, I have
started to get an itch to write down my thoughts again.  Thus, a new
blog.  I hope it is not a symptom of decreasing ability on my part.  I
am not yet completely sure what I will write here - for certain, it
will not overlap with the [Futhark devblog][].  One thing I will
certainly write down are my notes from the conferences I attend as
part of my academic career.  As a start, I may write down my notes
from my recent attendence of [FHPC'16][].
