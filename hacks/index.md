Minor scripts, hacks and patches
===========

I put minor hacks and scripts here.  Some may be of use to others but
me, but I expect that the majority will only be of educational or
entertainment value.  More fleshed-out instructive programs are in [a
different section](/programs).

Many of the scripts are written in
[`rc`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc), the command shell from the
Plan 9 operating system.  It is similar to classic POSIX bourne shell
script, but significantly simplified and, in my opinion, improved.
Should you wish to run them, you will need a port of `rc` to your
platform.  I personally use [9base](http://tools.suckless.org/9base),
a port of many of the standard Plan 9 tools to the POSIX environment
by the gentlemen and scholars at [suckless.org](http://suckless.org).
*Beware*: the reimplementation of `rc` for Unix by Byron Rakitzis is
incompatible in many fundamental and seemingly arbitrary ways, for
example by using `else` instead of `if not` as in Plan 9 `rc`.  Sadly,
this is the version you will get if you merely install the `rc`
package in Debian.  Install the `9base` package instead, and add
`/usr/lib/plan9/bin` to your path.  Also read [this guide to setting
up Plan 9 userland tools](/writings/guides/plan_9_tools.html).
