<p>In the early days in the web, before search engines and centralised link repositories (think <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a>) took over everything, every personal web page would have links to the personal pages of other people. Personal web pages are nothing like what they used to be (most just use Twitter it seems), but there are still some cool ones around. Here’s a list of the ones I think are worth checking out.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://bitreich.org/">Bitreich</a> is a radical splinter group from <a href="http://suckless.org/">suckless.org</a>. They focus on simple software and incomprehensible organisational politics (that I am pretty sure are at least partly a parody). If you followed the link, you’ll have discovered that the proper Bitreich website is not actually accessible over HTTP - instead, you are directed to use Gopher. I advice using the venerable text mode Gopher client (and browser) <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">lynx</a> to explore Gopherspace, with Bitreich as the starting point. It’s a surprisingly pleasant retro experience, and feels a lot more personal and decentralised than the modern web.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://danluu.com/">Dan Luu</a> is a programmer and writes interesting and very well-researched articles. <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">The one on computer input lag</a> is particularly worth checking out.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://drewdevault.com/">Drew DeVault</a> is the hacker behind things like <a href="https://swaywm.org/">sway</a> (an i3 clone for Wayland), <a href="https://sr.ht">sourcehut</a> (a source code and CI hosting site), and more. I really like his style of program design and his blog is very interesting.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/">John Regehr</a> is a professor at the University of Utah, and while his web page is very boring, <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/">his blog</a> is interesting. He tends to write about compilers and the horrors of undefined behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://metanohi.name/">Niels G. W. Serup</a> is one of my friends and he writes about important matters such as <a href="http://metanohi.name/two-spaces">why you should insert two spaces after a period</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com">Ted Unangst</a> is one of the motley crew making up the developers of <a href="https://openbsd.org">the best operating system</a>. He writes about when he is upset at the computer (most of the time) and when he is happy with the computer (less often).</p></li>
