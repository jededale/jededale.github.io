Personal details
==

My name is Troels Henriksen, I'm a hacker from Denmark.  Computing is
my primary passion, and I study it at home as well as at the
[University of Copenhagen](http://diku.dk), where I work as a
postdoctoral researcher.

My email address is <athas@sigkill.dk> and my public key is available
[here](pubkey.asc).

While I do have non-computer interests, this is the Internet, so I
won't get into those.  My computer interests are:

* **Simplicity.** I think modern computers are too slow, too fragile,
  and too incorrect, and I believe the root cause is uncontrolled
  complexity.  Attempts to introduce simplicity by mindlessly adding
  abstraction layers are ultimately counterproductive.  Simplicity is
  best achieved by lowering feature count and flexibility.

* **Freedom.** Important societal infrastructure code should be free
  from a moral point of view.  Other kinds of code should be free
  because collaborating is fun!

* **Tinkering.** Computers are toys for the mind.
