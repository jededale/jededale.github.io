Interesting programs
===

Herein you can find relatively small programs that are intended to be
read rather than used.  While I have my doubts about [Literate
Programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/) for large programs,
I still consider its principles extraordinarily valuable, and I will
try to write programs that are both illustrative and fun to read.

Pages containing programs will have a "source" link above the menu
that can be used to download the unformatted source code (literate
programs will still be literate, though).
