List of times I took the airplane
===

Air traffic is a significant contributor to global warming.
Unfortunately, I have a career where I have to fly often (to attend
conferences), and I do not have the willpower to force through much
change on my own.  All I can do is take the train or bus when viable,
and make a semi-exhibitionist log of all my journeys by plane, as is
seen below.  Some of these trips have been longer due to stopovers,
but I'm just listing the idealised flight distance.

2001 (4404km)
-------------

* **Copenhagen** to **Malta** and back (2x 2202km).  Family vacation.
  First long-distance flight, but I vaguely recall a sightseeing trip
  in a small Cessna or similar some time earlier.  Also my only trip
  prior to the post-9/11 security theater.

2011 (1530km)
-------------

* **Copenhagen** to **Bruxelles** and back (2x 765km) to attend [FOSDEM

  really wanted to take the train for this one, but I could not find a
  reasonable way.
